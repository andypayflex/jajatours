# Sanity CMS Webhook Integration
# To enable automatic rebuilds when content changes:
# 1. Netlify: Site settings -> Build & deploy -> Build hooks -> Add build hook (name: "Sanity Publish")
# 2. Sanity: sanity.io/manage -> [Project] -> API -> Webhooks -> Add webhook
#    - URL: paste the Netlify build hook URL
#    - Dataset: production
#    - Filter: _type in ["tour", "blogPost", "galleryImage", "testimonial"]
#    - Trigger on: Create, Update, Delete
