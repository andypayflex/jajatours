## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Online payment processing | Inquiry-based model — payments handled offline after personal contact |
| Multi-language support | English sufficient for v1 — add based on analytics data later |
| User accounts / login | No visitor accounts needed — adds friction, most customers book once |
| Live chat | WhatsApp covers real-time communication needs |
| Multi-currency display | International tourists can calculate — add when 20%+ international traffic confirmed |
| Real-time booking engine | Overkill for solo operator — inquiry model fits current capacity |
| Availability calendar widget | Manual WhatsApp handling sufficient until 500+ tours/year |
| Advanced tour filtering | Defer until offering 10+ tours |
| E-commerce / merchandise | Services site, not a shop |
