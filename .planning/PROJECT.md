# JaJa Tours

## What This Is

A website for JaJa Tours, a South African outdoor adventure touring company run by a solo tour guide. The site showcases overlanding tours, diving experiences, rafting, camping, and other outdoor adventures for both international tourists and local South Africans. Visitors browse tours, view galleries, read reviews, and inquire to book via WhatsApp or contact form.

## Core Value

Visitors can find a tour that excites them and easily inquire to book it — the site converts browsers into leads.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Tour listings with details, dates, pricing, and photos
- [ ] Fixed-schedule group tours with departure dates and availability
- [ ] Custom/private trip request flow
- [ ] WhatsApp click-to-chat with pre-filled tour details
- [ ] Contact form inquiry (name, dates, group size, tour interest)

- [ ] About page — meet the guide, experience, story

- [ ] Self-managed content — tour guide can add/edit tours, blog posts, gallery, and reviews without a developer
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design (tourists browse on phones)
- [ ] SEO-friendly for tourism search terms

### Out of Scope

- Online payment processing — inquiry-based booking only, payments handled offline
- Multi-language support — English is sufficient for v1
- User accounts / login — no need for visitors to create accounts
- Live chat — WhatsApp covers real-time communication
- E-commerce / merchandise — this is a services site, not a shop

## Context

- Based in South Africa, targeting both local and international audience
- Tour guide has active social media presence with existing followers and content
- Content is ready — photos, tour descriptions, and pricing exist
- Tours span multiple categories: overlanding, diving, rafting, camping, general outdoor adventures
- The guide operates solo — the CMS must be simple enough for a non-technical user
- Social media integration matters — Instagram/Facebook feeds or links should be visible
- South African internet conditions vary — site should load fast on slower connections

## Constraints

- **Content Management**: Must have a CMS the guide can use without technical knowledge — no code editing to update tours
- **Performance**: Fast load times essential — international visitors on varying connections, SA mobile data can be slow
- **Budget**: Solo operator — hosting and tooling costs should be minimal
- **SEO**: Must rank for South African adventure tourism terms to drive organic leads

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Inquiry-based booking (no payment) | Keeps v1 simple, guide prefers personal contact before payment | — Pending |
| Tech stack open | Developer decides best approach for self-managed CMS + performance | — Pending |
