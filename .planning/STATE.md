## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap structure: Derived 7 phases from natural requirement groupings (PERF → CMS → TOUR → MEDIA/COMM/TRUST → SEO)
- Dependency ordering: Performance infrastructure first, CMS second to enable content creation, tour content third as foundation for all other features
- Phase scope: Phase 1 includes both PERF requirements (load time + mobile responsiveness) as foundational infrastructure
- Image optimization: Sharp with lanczos3 kernel for superior quality, pre-configured Cloudinary domain
- TypeScript mode: Strictest mode for maximum type safety
- Asset caching: 1 year for hashed assets (immutable), 1 day for images
